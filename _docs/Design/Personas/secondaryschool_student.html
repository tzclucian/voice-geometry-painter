					<h5>Main Points</h5>
					<p>Persona like computers very much, especially video games. 
					Still, even if he spends a lot of time playing and exploring 
					computers space, he has great marks at school. Among his 
					favorite courses we can find Math, Literature and Biology, 
					while at the other end there are History and Imitative Arts.</p>
					<p>The reason why persona doesn&#39;t like to paint is because 
					he is left-handed when it comes to draw something (his 
					handwriting is also not pretty).</p>

					skills, while managing pretty well at operating computers.</p>

					a good influence on the class group and he also benefits of 
					greater attention from teachers. Thus, by finding this 
					application he may want to show his skills to his colleagues 
					or teachers, and so making the application known.</p>

					</ul>

			<h5>Scenarios</h5>
			<p>Persona is working on an interesting school project, where he 
			needs to create a logo from scratch. He hates drawing by hand, so he 
			thinks to look for an alternative solution. While surfing the web he 
			finds this drawing application that allows him to draw using his 
			voice. As this is interesting, he gives it a try. After a few 
			minutes of learning the basics he creates his logo. While presenting 
			the project at school, his colleagues and his teacher are pretty 
			surprised about the new logo. When he is asked on how he created 
			it, he proudly describes them the cool application that he 
			discovered.</p>
