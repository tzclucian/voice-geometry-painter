				<h5>Detailed Description</h5>
				<p>Persona loves his son. Persona also loves his job and the technical details involved. He also likes all the diagramas and the blueprints he is working with but hates the fact he doesn't know how to create them in a digital format. Persona wishes his son will follow his track and hopes that by helping him doing the geometry homeworks he will develop an attraction to the construction domain.</p>
				<p>Persona doesn't have IT knowledge and can't create complex digital blueprints but he sees the potential. He is also looking for a very basic app in order to start learning the basics of computers.</p>
				<p>He is involved in the school meetings between teachers and parents and he is seen as a great man with a strong opinion. He can pursue the teacher and the school stuff to try and use the application if it proves itself useful at home.</p>
			</div>

		<div class="personaScenarios">
			<h5>Scenarios</h5>
			<p>Persona will use the software to help the child finish his homework. He expects the application to be handy and save him from drawing.</p>
			<p>Persona forgot the theory regarding the basic geometry figures so he expects help from the UI. He wants documentation links to certain geometrical figures where he can read and remember details.</p>
			<p>Persona might use the application for fast calculus when he has unfinished work that needs to be done at home. He expects the application to be scalable and help him even at higher levels.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="otherDetails">
			<h5>Other Details</h5>
			<p>Persona wishes the most for his child. He wants him to have a better learning environment and to acomplish this he is ready to make multiple sacrifices.</p>
