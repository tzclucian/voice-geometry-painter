				<h5>Detailed Description</h5>
				<p>This is the new era teacher. She has a degree on mathematics obtained some years ago when the UAIC Mathematics Faculty was globally known for its teachers but especially brilliant students. She is the old-school teacher but loves technology. She doesn't have too many experience with IT or vocally controlled applications but she is willing to try. The persona sees the full potential of the application and realizes that it can come in her help by saving her time, getting her more focus form the students and not in the end save paper. This persona is passionate about ecology.</p>

		<div class="personaScenarios">
			<h5>Scenarios</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>Persona will use the app for teaching but for evaluating students as well. She expects the app to be robust and very solid against students pranks or tricks.</li>
				<li>Persona wants to develop very many custom instruments and build a very powerful set of tools besides the default one. She expects quality support as she might be the one that gets the app in her school.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="otherDetails">
			<h5>Other Details</h5>
			<p>Persona decisions are taken by balancing the advantages and the disadvantages. There are moments when she can get enthusiastic very fast but in case of failure the trial product will never receive another chance.</p>
